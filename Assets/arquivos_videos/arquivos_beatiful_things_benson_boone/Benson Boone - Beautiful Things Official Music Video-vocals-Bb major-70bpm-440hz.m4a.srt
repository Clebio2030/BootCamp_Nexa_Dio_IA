00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,350
(Transcribed by Sonix.ai - Remove this message by upgrading your Sonix account) For what that is worth.

2
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:17,540
But lately I've been doing better then the
last four cold Decembers I recall.

3
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,110
And I see my family every month.

4
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,140
I found a girl my parents love.

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,690
She'll come and stay the night.

6
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,540
And I think I might have it all.

7
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:39,860
And I thank God every day for the girl he
sent my way.

8
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,200
But I know the things he gives me, he can
take away.

9
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:54,620
In I hold you every night, and that's a
feeling I won't get used to.

10
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:04,010
But there's no man as terrified as the man
who stands to lose you.

11
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,810
Oh, hope I don't lose you.

12
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,730
Please stay.

13
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,640
I want you, I need you.

14
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,720
Oh, God.

15
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,630
Don't take.

16
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,000
It is beautiful.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,530
Things that I've got.

18
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,230
Please stay.

19
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,350
I want you, I need you.

20
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:40,180
And you'd take these beautiful things that
I've gone.

21
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,170
Please don't take.

22
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,970
I found my mind.

23
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,680
I'm feeling sane.

24
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,040
It's been a while, but I'm finding my face.

25
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,410
If everything's good and it's great.

26
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,260
Why do I sit and wait till it's gone?

27
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,390
Oh, I tell you I know I've got enough.

28
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,510
I've got peace and I've got love.

29
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,640
But I'm up at night thinking I just might
lose it all.

30
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:24,150
Oh. Please stay.

31
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,390
I want you, I need you.

32
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:35,070
Oh, God. Don't take these beautiful things
of God.

33
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,550
Stay.

34
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,970
Please stay.

35
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,810
I want you, I need you.

36
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,740
Oh, God, I need.

37
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,710
These beautiful things that I've got. (Transcribed by Sonix.ai - Remove this message by upgrading your Sonix account)
