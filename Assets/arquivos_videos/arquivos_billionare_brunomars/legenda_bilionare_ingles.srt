1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:10,680
I want to be a billionaire so fucking bad by all of the things I never had.

2
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:21,990
I want to be on the cover of Forbes magazine, smiling next to Oprah and the Queen.

3
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:33,420
Oh, every time I close my eyes, I see my name in shining lights.

4
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,920
Yeah, a different city every night.

5
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:45,990
Oh, I swear the world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire.

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,650
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah.

7
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,470
I would be the host of Everyday Christmas.

8
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,970
Give me a wish list.

9
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:59,160
I probably pull a Angelina and Brad Pitt and adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit.

10
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,010
Give away a few Mercedes like, here, let me have this.

11
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,830
And last but not least, grant somebody's last wish.

12
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,140
It's been a couple months that I've been single.

13
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,120
So you can call me Travie Claus.

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,320
Midas the ho ho.

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,220
Get it?

16
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,110
I'll probably visit with Katrina hit and damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did.

17
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,780
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid.

18
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,570
Everywhere I go, I might have my own theme music.

19
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,060
Every time I close my.

20
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,140
Eyes.

21
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:30,870
What you see, what you see I see my name in shining lights.

22
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,040
I guess.

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,190
Yeah.

24
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:32,640
What else?

25
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,670
A different city every night.

26
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,920
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

27
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:43,890
Swear the world better prepared for when I'm a billionaire.

28
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,470
Oh oh, when I'm a billionaire.

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,820
Oh.

30
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,890
Oh, God.

31
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,890
I'll be playing basketball with the president.

32
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,420
Dunking on his delegates.

33
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,060
And I compliment him on his political etiquette.

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,700
Toss a couple million in the air just for the heck of it.

35
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,700
But keep the 520 tens and bins completely separate.

36
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,580
Yeah, I'll be in the whole new tax bracket.

37
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,600
We in recession.

38
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,280
But let me take a crack at it.

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,920
I probably take whatever's left and just split it up.

40
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:20,490
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks and not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was.

41
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,140
Eatin good, sleeping soundly.

42
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,450
I know we all have a similar dream.

43
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,720
Go in your pocket, pull out your wallet, put it in the air and sing.

44
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,240
I wanna be a billionaire.

45
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,910
So fucking bad, so bad.

46
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,570
By all of the things I never had.

47
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:43,740
Everything I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine.

48
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,280
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen.

49
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,390
What up Oprah?

50
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,460
Oh, every time I close my eyes.

51
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,430
What you see, what you see, bruh I see my name.

52
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,130
In shiny lights.

53
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,050
And what else?

54
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,990
A different city every night.

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah I swear the world better prepare.

56
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,120
For when I'm a billionaire.

57
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,600
Yeah.

58
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,850
Oh oh.

59
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,670
Singing when I'm a billionaire.

60
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,210
Oh oh.

61
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,950
I want to be a billionaire.

62
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,490
So fucking bad.
