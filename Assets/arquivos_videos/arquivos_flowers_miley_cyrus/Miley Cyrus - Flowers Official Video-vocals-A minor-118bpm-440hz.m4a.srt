00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,600

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,340
We were cold.

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,360
Kind of dream that can't be sold.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,860
We were right till we weren't.

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,340
Built a home and watched it burn.

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,820

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,560
Write my name in sand.

10
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,820
Talk to myself for hours.

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,420
See things you don't understand.

12
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,560
I can take myself dancing and I can hold my own.

Cherry red.

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,230
Match the roses that you left.

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:24,390
No remorse, no regret I forgive every word you say.

22
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,460

Write my name in sand.
