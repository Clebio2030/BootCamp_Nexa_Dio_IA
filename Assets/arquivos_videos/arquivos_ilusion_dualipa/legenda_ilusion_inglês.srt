1
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,280
I've been known to miss a red flag.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,600
I've been known to put my love on a pedestal.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,050
In the end, those things just don't last.

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:19,160
And it's time I take my rose colored glasses off.

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,480
I already know you take to me the things I'd like to see.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,060
Maybe you feel like taking me for a ride.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,410
Know your time.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,850
Think about your kids, right?

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,660
Don't you know I could do this dance all night?

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:34,980
Ooh.

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,350
What you doing?

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,040
Don't know who you think that you're confusing.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,510
I'd be like, ooh.

14
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,970
It's amusing.

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:51,150
You think I'm gonna fall for an illusion?

16
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:52,660
Hey.

17
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,300
No, no.

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:54,900
No.

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,470
Dance.

20
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:55,890
No!

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,210
I'd be lying.

22
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,140
Dance all night.

23
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,940
Dance all night.

24
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:02,990
Dance.

25
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:07,730
This was the time when that she might have worked.

26
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,900
Was the time when I just threw a match and let it burn.

27
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:21,290
Now I'm grown I know what I deserve I still like dancing with the lessons I already learned I know your type.

28
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,130
Two things I like truly make me yours for life.

29
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,570
Take me for a ride.

30
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:28,850
Enjoy your time.

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,260
Think about your country.

32
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,100
Don't you know I could do this dance all night?

33
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,390
Ooh.

34
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,820
What you doing?

35
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:38,870
Don't know.

36
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,540
Who do you think that you're confusing?

37
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,290
I'd be like, ooh, it's amusing.

38
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,820
You think I'm gonna.

39
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,500
Fall for an aloof.

40
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,990
Oh, what a shame.

41
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,870
Hey, dance all night.

42
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,640
Have you left it so late?

43
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,530
Dance all night.

44
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,420
Dance all night.

45
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,980
Is this.

46
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:05,990
Losing?

47
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,770
I really like the way you're moving.

48
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,640
Yeah.

49
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,890
I just wanna dance with the loser.

50
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,770
Yeah I just wanna dance with.

51
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,460
Yeah, I just wanna dance with I could dance all night.

52
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,000
Hey.

53
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:42,060
So what you do when you don't know who you think that you're confusing?

54
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,780
I'd be like, ooh, it's amusing.

55
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,150
You think I'm gonna fall for it?

56
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,060
Oh.

57
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,050
What you.

58
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,340
Doing?

59
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,150
Don't know who you think that you're confusing.

60
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,870
I'd be like, ooh, it's amusing.

61
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,270
You think I'm grateful for it?

62
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,900
Or do.

63
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,830
Asian.
